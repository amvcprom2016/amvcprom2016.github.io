<h1>EPQ</h1>
<div class="panel panel-default">
	This is a place where I will put my research, drafts and final submission for my EPQ dissertation.

<div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading">Initial Ideas</div><div class="panel-body">I want to do my EPQ on something maths or programming related to show off my passion for Computer Science to any universities. If I don't do it on something related to the field I want to go into, then it's likely it won't be worth anything for the application. Part of me wants to do it based on AI, and explore how much a computer can really think. But that involves a lot of research and could lead to a more than 5000 word essay. Aside from that, maybe something to do with computer networks, websites, or a mathematical proof. These types of projects would be interesting to do, and help my application to a university for a Computer Science or Maths course.</div></div>
<div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading">The concept of genetic algorithms</div><div class="panel-body">I found <a href="http://www.primaryobjects.com/CMS/Article149.aspx">this</a> article which explains quite simply about genetic algorithms and how you can make an algorithm evolve as it goes to create an optimized and efficient one. The general idea is that the AI starts with only the base information of what commands it can use and is given a random instruction as a "gene". A genome is an array of "genes" or commands, the genomes are tested for accuracy and then speed/efficiency. The best ones are kept and more are made until you eventually gain a result which is usable. The concept takes a while and can only be used for more simple applications. But suppose you could speed this generation up and eventually create a program which is able to write other programs given some basic parameters.</div></div>
