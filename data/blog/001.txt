Past should be past
25/08/2014
The whole point of this blog is about motivation and improvement of me as a person, and when I returned from the UKMT Summer School I was highly motivated to try and improve my quality of life. The only problem is the prejudice received by my family and people I know. The thing is, you are judged by people you know and they expect you to act in a certain way. This means that when you try to change sometimes the people around you will quote you on your previous behaviors and habits forcing you back into those patterns. This means that I was almost a completely different person at the summer school and within days of being home I am reverting to my prior self. I now have goals, and feel highly motivated to achieve them to be with Solene. I am not entirely sure I can get into a university such as Cambridge anymore, my GCSE results were definitely not to high enough level. It is said that Cambridge University do not care too much about GCSE grades, and I hope that is true, as I believe I can do well in my A level subjects. The only problem I see is that I am doing less subjects than some other people who would also be applying to Cambridge, so I am not entirely sure it is feasible they would accept me over the other applicants. I want to try and do Pure Maths, and Statistics as extra A level qualifications but they are relatively similar to the other two maths qualifications so it's not confirmed that the university would regard them as well as things such as another Science or other subject of a different nature. If it means isolating myself for the next two years so I can have a good life later on, then it's worth it. After all, the past is the past, so in the future, I would only regret not trying as hard, I wouldn't regret achieving my goals.
