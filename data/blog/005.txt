Can't go wrong
18/09/2014
I feel as though I have not changed as much as I would like, however I am working considerably more than I used to, however, it still may not be enough to get where I want so I will keep trying to increase my workload whilst not tiring myself mentally. The school library is ordering a book for me, Graph Theory by Reinhard Diestel, it expands on combinatorics and graph theory which are university level subjects. I am intending on basing my EPQ on something related to that as opposed to about computer AI but am not entirely sure which is a better idea, I will most likely ask which has the higher potential for more marks, and if they are similar go for graph theory, as it would show an advanced understanding to the university I apply to. As a side note I have started listening to Phillip Phillips, who has an album full of motivation songs that I am liking more and more as I listen to them. <div class="well well-sm"><i>I can't go wrong, as long as I remember where I'm from<br>Hold my head up just to keep it clear<br>I want a chance just to face my fear, face my fear</i></div> The lyrics of this song are true to me right now at the stage I am at. I feel highly motivated and feel like I can accomplish my goals as long as I keep my reasons close and use them as further motivation. I simply want a chance to prove that I can comeback from my poor GCSE performance and get into Cambridge. I am going to try and find out if I can redesign the school intranet as a piece of work for my portfolio.
