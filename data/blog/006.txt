Resetting of Goals
20/10/2014
Well... it's been a month since my last post, and although I've updated the goals, my motivation has dropped drastically. I feel I am ready to hit this again as hard as I can and give it another go, however, a lot of time has been wasted which is not ideal. I am going to start a plan of my own design called Pure Pasha to grow my muscles put on weight and become like Pasha, a CS:GO player who is becoming a hero to me. The requirements to succeed a day of it will include: Dumbbell curls x30, Concentrated curls x20, Hammer curls x30, Shoulder curls x20, Preacher curls x20, Press-ups x5, Exercise Bike Steady (10 mins), Exercise Bike Sprint (10 mins), Drink water (8 glasses). I will keep a track of how many days I complete, and aim to do at least 5 a day. I feel as though I need to become more attractive before any girls will see me in the way I wish to be seen. This motivation is a boost, and my original aims are still clear in my head so I hope to capitalize on this motivation. School is going well although I have started to miss out on some work and have less motivation, so this needs to be sorted. There is the UKMT senior challenge after half-term, and the UKMT team challenge sometime soon, which I will prepare for to try my best to do well. I have also received the first problem sheet from the UKMT mentoring scheme, which needs to be done and handed back. Apart from that everything is still going smoothly, and I hope to get the train back on the tracks.
